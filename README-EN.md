# âš¡ IRStorm - Full Access to Linux & Docker From Inside Iran

> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡· Developed by [IRRadar](https://t.me/IRRadar)

**IRStorm** unlocks full access to package mirrors and Docker images â€” even inside restricted Iranian datacenters.

âœ… No VPN, proxy, or manual hacks  
âœ… Installs & updates packages at full speed  
âœ… Access Docker Hub without 403 errors  
âœ… Fully automated setup  
âœ… Works on Ubuntu and Alpine

---

## ðŸš« The Problem:

Most Iranian datacenters (e.g., Afranet, Shatelhost, ParsOnline...) block access to:
- `archive.ubuntu.com`
- `security.ubuntu.com`
- `hub.docker.com`

That means: no apt update, no Docker pulls, and total lock-in.

---

## âœ… IRStormâ€™s Solution:

IRStorm configures clean Iranian DNS + optimized mirrors that bypass both international **sanctions** and **domestic filtering** â€” no VPN or DNS tricks needed.

Run your servers like you're abroad.

## ðŸš€ Just paste this one-liner to fix it all:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRRadar/scripts/main/irr_setup.sh)
